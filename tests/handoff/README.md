# Handoff E2E test

End-to-end test of the **Phase 1 → Phase 2 handoff** in the starter kit:
the moment when `setup-mac.sh` / `setup-windows.ps1` finishes installing
tools and hands control to Claude, who then reads `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`
and finishes setup.

This test runs the real setup script, lets it fire `claude -p` with the
production handoff prompt (in headless print mode so CI doesn't hang on
an interactive REPL), then asserts on disk that Claude actually did the
Phase 2 work.

## What it tests

After the headless handoff completes, `assert.sh` / `assert.ps1` verifies:

1. `~/.elnora/profiles.toml` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.elnora\profiles.toml`)
   contains `api_key = "elnora_live_…"`, AND `elnora auth status` returns
   success — i.e. Claude actually authenticated the CLI, not just dropped
   a useless `.env` file the CLI doesn't read.
2. `.git/` exists with at least one commit on `main`, and `git remote` is
   empty (headless mode skips the GitHub bootstrap on purpose — no
   credentials, no browser).
3. `.claude/knowledge-base.local.md` was created and the placeholder is gone.
4. The `### First-run setup` block in `CLAUDE.md` was self-deleted.
5. The transcript contains the `HANDOFF_COMPLETE` marker.
6. The transcript shows Claude ran an Elnora CLI auth/verification command
   (`whoami`, `doctor`, `auth login`, or `auth status`) — not just
   `elnora --version`.

## How to run it (manual only)

The test is opt-in — `workflow_dispatch` only, no schedule, no on-push trigger.

### 1. Set up secrets (one time)

You need two API keys. Paste them into GitHub repo secrets:

> **GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret name | Where to get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Org secret (Elnora-AI → Settings → Secrets); keys at https://openrouter.ai/keys | Claude Code reaches OpenRouter through `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with `openrouter/auto`; the workflow sets that up. Keep a low credit limit on the key so a runaway test can't spike the bill. |
| `ELNORA_API_KEY_TEST` | https://platform.elnora.ai/settings → API Keys | Use a **dedicated test account**, not your personal one. Every run hits `elnora whoami` and `elnora doctor`. |

**For local testing** (running the headless mode on your own Mac), paste
the same values into `.env` at the repo root — that file is gitignored.

### 2. Trigger the workflow

```bash
gh workflow run handoff-e2e.yml -f os=both
```

Or use the GitHub UI: Actions → handoff-e2e → Run workflow.

`os` accepts `both` (default), `macos`, or `windows` if you only want one
platform.

### 3. Read the result

- The workflow prints the install log tail and transcript tail in the
  step output — usually enough to debug a failure.
- The full transcript is uploaded as an artifact
  (`handoff-transcript-macos` / `handoff-transcript-windows`) — download
  it from the workflow run page if you need to inspect every Claude turn.
- Assertion failures are listed at the bottom of the assertions step.

## Running headless mode locally (no CI)

Useful for debugging when the GitHub workflow is failing and you want a
faster loop. Paste your keys into `.env`, then:

```bash
# Mac:
ELNORA_HANDOFF_MODE=headless \
ELNORA_HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT="$PWD/handoff-transcript.jsonl" \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$(grep ^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= .env | cut -d= -f2-)" \
ELNORA_API_KEY="$(grep ^ELNORA_API_KEY= .env | cut -d= -f2-)" \
bash setup-mac.sh

tests/handoff/assert.sh "$PWD" "$PWD/handoff-transcript.jsonl"
```

```powershell
# Windows:
$env:ELNORA_HANDOFF_MODE = "headless"
$env:ELNORA_HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT = "$PWD\handoff-transcript.jsonl"
# Source ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and ELNORA_API_KEY from .env or paste them
.\setup-windows.ps1
.\tests\handoff\assert.ps1 -RepoDir $PWD -Transcript "$PWD\handoff-transcript.jsonl"
```

> ⚠️ Running locally re-runs the full Phase 1 install path too. If you've
> already got everything installed it's a no-op; otherwise it'll install
> tools on your machine.

## How the handoff knows it's in test mode

The contract is two env vars:

- `ELNORA_HANDOFF_MODE=headless` — switches `setup-mac.sh` / `setup-windows.ps1`
  from `exec claude "<prompt>"` (interactive REPL) to `claude -p "<same
  prompt>" --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format stream-json
  --verbose --max-turns 50` (one-shot, captured to transcript).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for Claude Code to skip browser OAuth.

The handoff prompt is **byte-for-byte identical** between production and
headless mode — defined once in each setup script. Divergence there is
the bug this test is supposed to catch.

`INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md` has a "Non-interactive / test mode" section that
tells Claude what to do when `ELNORA_HANDOFF_MODE=headless` is set: pull
the API key from env instead of asking, use the staged Obsidian vault,
skip the optional sample-protocol step, and print `HANDOFF_COMPLETE` at
the end.

## Cost & frequency

- ~20-30 Claude turns per run, mostly Sonnet-class work (file reads, edits,
  bash commands). Cache hit rate is consistently >93%.
- Measured at **~$0.45-0.55 per run per OS** on current Sonnet pricing
  (handoff-e2e + bootstrap-e2e together: ~$2 per full both-OS audit).
  This is a floor, not a guarantee — if `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md` grows or
  the agent's flow has to recover from new errors, expect drift upward.
- Total agent wall time: ~2-3 min per OS (so a both-OS run finishes in
  ~5 min total, parallel). The job-level "15-25 min" timeout is a
  generous ceiling, not the expected runtime.
- No schedule, no auto-trigger. Run it when:
  - You changed `setup-mac.sh`, `setup-windows.ps1`, or `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md`.
  - You want a confidence check before a release.
  - Something feels off and you want ground truth on what Claude does.
